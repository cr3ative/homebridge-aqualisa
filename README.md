This is a placeholder while I try and make my internet-enabled shower smart. I deserve this dumb future.

# API Notes

API appears to be https://github.com/dingo/api based on the error code
Base URL is https://aqualisa.like.st/api/ 

Making blind requests until it works:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.nodes.v1+json;" https://aqualisa.like.st/api/
{"message":"Missing [N-Meta] header","code":400}%  
```

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.nodes.v1+json;" -H "N-Meta: android;1.0.1" https://aqualisa.like.st/api/
{"message":"Environment is not supported, should be: local,development,staging,production","code":400}% 
```

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.nodes.v1+json;" -H "N-Meta: android;production; (1.0.1)" https://aqualisa.like.st/api/
{"message":"Missing device os version","code":400}%
```

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.nodes.v1+json;" -H "N-Meta: android;production;28; (1.0.1)" https://aqualisa.like.st/api/
{"message":"Missing device","code":400}%
```

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.nodes.v1+json;" -H "N-Meta: android;production;28;pie; (1.0.1)" https://aqualisa.like.st/api/
{"message":"404: Not Found","code":500}%  
```

Wheyyyy. Nice of it to tell us what to send it.

Let's try a dingo URL we know of:

```bash
curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/vnd.nodes.v1+json;" -H "N-Meta: android;production;28;pie; (1.0.1)" https://aqualisa.like.st/api/users
{"message":"405: Method Not Allowed","code":500}%  
```

Okay, that's a valid path. Let's find the rest in the Android APK.
